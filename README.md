The `pin-input-react` is a react component to be used when you want a pin component. This component is being develop to be very generic to attend many user cases as possible.

## Install

**The package is unpublished**

```bash
npm install --save pin-input-react

yarn add pin-input-react
```

## Usage

A example of usage can be found [here](./example/src/App.tsx).

the component accepts 3 other component:
* pinComponent - required and is used as each pin value
* pinComponentOnFocus - is used when the pin position is focused
* pinComponentOnFill - is used when the pin position has a value

If you set showValues, make sure the **`pinComponentOnFocus`** get his chield, becaused it will be used to insert the content. The same to pinText, which is used to receive the values. Any questions, [here](./example/src/App.tsx) show a implementation.
